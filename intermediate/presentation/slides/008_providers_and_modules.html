  <h2>Providers and Modules</h2>

    Terraform uses providers to interact with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together.

    MCM team only supports official HashiCorp providers.

  <h2>Modules</h2>
  <p style="font-size: large">
   Internally developped modules can be consumed without a doubt from the TFE registry.
  </p>
   <p style="font-size: large">
   Well-known public ones are synced as well and can be recognized with <b>-synced</b> suffix.
  </p>

   <p class="fragment fade-in" style="font-size: large; color: red">Attention: There is no active prevention of consuming public modules, only an advisory sentinel policy kicks in. You are accountable and responsible for the consequences.</p>
